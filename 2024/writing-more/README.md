## Writing more

I recently saw a twitter account whose tag line was "producing more than consuming". This got me thinking about everything I have read over the year about writing. All the blogs claiming writing is thinking, it allows for better thought. Whilst I have personally experienced it slightly while writing a blog about HTTP livestreaming protocols, I never got around to doing it consistently.

Closest I have ever got was trying to write note-worthy things I did in my daily job. Sadly I have dropped doing that too. But now at this point in life, I want to have more clearer thinking. I have been super confused this whole year, I shifted to Bangalore, started attending shit ton of meetups, met so many more awesome people, made some really awesome connections. Shifted to a new house in Bangalore, settling down life more and more there. These feel like great progress items, but it all fell down when my manager asked me a simple question, how do you want to progress in this company. For context, I have been working in the current company for more than 2 years and its mostly being "fuck around and find out". And that's what I replied, but yeah that definitely wasn't a good answer. I have also had a couple of other thoughts in my mind related to my career/higher studies, but it's all just thoughts, no clarity/concrete steps.

Of course, I don't think writing will magically help me figure out my career path or level up uncertainities in life, but even if it helps 1% in getting more clarity that's good enough to try it out. Another reason, I want to get more into writing stems from me forgetting things. I have worked on some nice projects since I have started diving deep into more and more technologies. But I forget its intricacies, and what's the best way to remember about them? Writing a nice structured blog. I am not confident enough to record raw videos of me working, and as such they will be super long, cause I am somehow slower than a lot of my peers, so a no-go for that rn. I can always come back to those blogs and understand what I did in those projects.

One clarity I want to give is I don't want to try journalling, I have tried it before, and ended up dropping it. I so don't want to drop writing this time. So no daily logs, but definitely spaced repeated look at things.

So yeah, this is it, to summarize, I want to write more to:
- understand what I am trying to do more deeply
- make a more polished archive of things I learn and being able to retain them longer
- come out of just consumption loop

What I don't want to do:
- Daily journalling
